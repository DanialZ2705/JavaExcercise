# Java Simple Excercise

This repository contains practice exercises and solutions for learning Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

# What is Java?

Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence ("Write Once, Run Anywhere"). This means Java code can run on various operating systems with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. Its popularity stems from its readability, robust features, and vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

# What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects. An object encapsulates data (attributes) and the actions that can be performed on that data (methods).  Key principles of OOP include:

Classes: Blueprints for creating objects with specific attributes and methods.
Objects: Instances of a class that contain data and can perform actions.
Inheritance: Creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing ones (superclasses).
Polymorphism: The ability of objects to respond differently to the same message.
Encapsulation: Protecting data by restricting direct access and providing controlled methods for manipulation.

# Practices Included

This repository includes practice exercises covering fundamental Java and OOP concepts like:

Variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements (if/else, loops)

Arrays and Strings manipulation



Classes and objects creation with attributes and methods

Access modifiers (public, private)

Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation practices
